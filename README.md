Prerequisites
Git

Ballerina (version 2201.7.0 or higher)

cURL (for API testing)

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-api.git
cd student-management-api
2. Project Structure
text
student-management-api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ course_crud.bal    # Main Ballerina service file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This documentation
3. Build the Project

    "courseCode":"DSA621S",
    "designation":"Computer Science Major"
  },
  {
    "id":"202099999",
    "name":"Alice Maxine",
    "courseCode":"WIL721S",
    "designation":"Graduate Intern"
  }
]
Error Handling
The API returns appropriate error messages with HTTP status codes:

400 Bad Request: Invalid input parameters

404 Not Found: Student not found

409 Conflict: Attempt to add existing student

500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server errors

Logging
All operations are logged to the console:

text
[2023-10-15 10:30:45,000] INFO {course_crud} - Student added: 202099999
[2023-10-15 10:31:22,000] WARN {course_crud} - Student not found for ID: 202011111
Stopping the Service
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the service is running to stop it.

Troubleshooting
Port Conflict: If port 8080 is in use:

bash
bal run -- port=9090
Then update curl commands to use the new port

Ballerina Not Found: Verify installation with:

bash
bal version
cURL Errors: Ensure JSON formatting is correct and use double quotes in Windows CMD:

cmd
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/students/addStudent -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"id\":\"202099999\", \"name\":\"Alice Max\", \"courseCode\":\"WIL721S\", \"designation\":\"Intern\"}"
