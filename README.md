üèÅ Project Overview
This project implements a RESTful API for student management using Ballerina. It provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with an in-memory storage solution. The API allows you to:

Add new student records

Retrieve student information by ID

Update existing student records

Delete student records

List all students in the system

The system uses Ballerina's built-in HTTP service capabilities and table data structure for efficient in-memory storage with O(1) lookups using student ID as the primary key.

Key Components:

HTTP Listener: Handles incoming requests on port 8080

Student Service: Processes REST API requests

In-Memory Table: Stores student records with ID as primary key

Logger: Records system events and operations
